# Decentralizing the Future of Digital Publishing

## Project Overview

**Blocklicense** is a Web3 content licensing registry and relicensing marketplace specifically designed for text-based journalistic content. It enables authors to establish ownership of their work, facilitating downstream licensing transactions that extend these ownership rights with the authorâ€™s permission.

**CTRL+X** supports the development of public benefit infrastructure that empowers journalists to continue their vital work while expanding public access to journalistic content. By leveraging content licensing technology, CTRL+X helps maintain the historical record, fosters collaboration among journalists, and enhances monetization opportunities for their work.

### Problem Statement

Journalists face significant challenges in maintaining ownership of their content due to the phenomenon known as Platform Collapse, leading to:

- **Limited distribution**
- **Poor monetization**
- **Disappearing content** (e.g., link rot, memory holing)

These issues contribute to an environment where misinformation can easily proliferate and create a chilling effect within the journalism field.

### Solution

CTRL+X content licensing software provides immutable rights to authors, enabling buyer/seller transactions on a per-article basis through a blockchain-based solution for digital rights management. This allows authors to:

- Enhance distribution of their articles across multiple platforms
- Better monetize their published works
- Future-proof their content against platform collapse

### Why Now?

- The demand for quality journalism is higher than ever.
- Journalism needs sustainable **infrastructure** to thrive.
- More journalists are operating independently, giving them increased legal leverage to negotiate rights with corporate media institutions.
- Without open and sustainable infrastructure, we risk heading toward a digital information collapse.
- Current Web2 for-profit platform technology cannot support the ongoing transition in digital journalism.

## How to Run the Project

To start the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** - React framework for building user interfaces and use api routes to create the Solana actions for Blink.
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and code clarity.
- **Blink (Solana)** - Blockchain link that turns any Solana action into a shareable, metadata-rich link.
- **Metaplex** - OS NFT protocol for minting and managing NFTs.
- **Phantom Wallet** - A popular NFT wallet for Solana-based assets.

*(Future Enhancement: 
Integration with Tiplink for wallet connection. 
Metaplex - OS NFT protocol for minting and managing NFTs.)*
